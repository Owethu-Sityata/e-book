        <h2>The high-tech Hunger Games</h2>
        <p>Thabo went to KFC to buy some chicken. He wanted a simple meal, either the Streetwise menu or a family bucket. Just give him his chicken, and he's happy.<br><br>

            As he entered, he felt like he'd stepped into a whole new world. The restaurant was filled with screens everywhere! Ten big TVs showed more menu options than he had apps on his phone.<br><br>
            
            Thabo stood there, thinking, "Are they selling chicken or something else?" He approached a screen, squinting like he was reading a difficult book.<br><br>
            
            "Spicy Crunch Zinger Tower Triple Deluxe Extra Combo" and "Mega Wedges 3.0" stared back at him. Where was his humble Streetwise Two?<br><br>
            
            Thabo touched the screen, and it lit up with even more options. "Upgrade to Colonel's Gold Deluxe Edition meal for R10.99?" He thought, "Am I buying chicken or concert tickets?"<br><br>
            
            Everyone around him seemed to navigate the technology easily, customizing meals like pros. Meanwhile, Thabo sweated, scrolling through options like he was browsing online.<br><br>
            
            The screen asked him, "Are you sure you just want a Streetwise Two?" Thabo's frustration mounted. Finally, after what felt like forever, he made his selection.<br><br>
            
            His order popped up, R300! Thabo was stunned. He'd inadvertently ordered enough for a family reunion.<br><br>
            
            He looked around, wondering who had placed that massive order. Then it hit him ,it was him, trying to grab a simple Streetwise Two.<br><br>
            
            Thabo left KFC with a feast he didn't want and a newfound respect for those screens. As he took a bite of his crispy chicken, Thabo smiled and thought, “Next time, I'll know what I'm getting into.” <br><br>
            
            But one thing was certain, whether you're after the classics or looking to try something new, KFC is always ready to “Add Hope” to your day, one meal at a time.</p>
