        <h2>Lost in Translation</h2>
        <p>During school holidays, 7-year-old Themba Mkhize tagged along with his mom to her job as a domestic worker. While she cleaned the massive house, Themba entertained himself with Rudy, the white kid she watched.<br><br>

            This house was unlike any Themba had seen. The backyard boasted a theme park, complete with swings, slides, and merry-go-rounds. Themba thought, "What is this, Disneyland for one?"<br><br>
            
            Rudy, eager to play, approached Themba. "Can you give me a swing?" she asked.<br><br>
            
            Themba's English vocabulary consisted of just two words: "yes" and "no." He hesitated, unsure which was the right answer.<br><br>
            
            "Can you give me a swing?" Rudy repeated.<br><br>
            
            Themba replied, "Yes."<br><br>
            
            Five seconds later, Rudy asked again, "Can you give me a swing?"<br><br>
            
            This time, Themba said, "No."<br><br>
            
            Their exchange became a comedic tennis match: "Yes." "No." "Yes." "No." Rudy's hopes and dreams were the ball, and Themba was unintentionally smashing them straight into the net.<br><br>
            
            Rudy burst into tears, and Themba stood bewildered. "Why is she crying? I'm answering all her questions!" he thought.<br><br>
            
            Years passed, and Themba learned to speak English fluently. He mastered effective communication and gained confidence in his responses.<br><br>
            
            Looking back, Themba chuckled. "It's not just about language; it's about growth." He imagined Rudy's pride if she saw him now.<br><br>
            
            Perhaps Rudy would still cry, but this time, Themba could explain why.</p>
