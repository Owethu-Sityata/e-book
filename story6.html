        <h2>A letter to Coach Matika</h2>
        <p>Dear Coach Matika,<br><br>

            As I sit down to write, I realize it's been twenty years since that transformative time at the Life Choices bootcamp, the last time I had the privilege of seeing you, and I'm thrilled to share the incredible journey I've been on since then. So much of what I have achieved is rooted in the guidance you gave me and the invaluable lessons you shared. I have grown beyond my wildest dreams, and now, I am living a life that reflects everything you taught us about ambition, resilience, and purpose.<br><br>
            
            Today, I am the CEO of LeverEdge Media & Tech Solutions, a company I co-founded with my lifelong friend, Zeigh. What began as a modest venture has grown into a powerhouse in the tech and media industries. Together, we've built a company that thrives on innovation, creativity, and integrity. LeverEdge has become known not only for its pioneering technology solutions but also for its influence in the media landscape. Thanks to Zeigh's expertise in media and marketing, we have crafted a brand that stands out and speaks directly to audiences worldwide.<br><br>
            
            LeverEdge Media & Tech Solutions operates on two main pillars: high-impact tech services and dynamic media ventures. On the tech side, we provide cutting-edge software and AI-driven solutions that empower businesses across various sectors. We've become the go-to for startups and established companies alike, providing everything from app development to AI consultancy and data management. Our focus is always on creating simple, efficient, and transformative tech , following the “KISS” principle you taught us.<br><br>
            
            In the media realm, we have extended our influence through partnerships, a social media presence, and even our own production studio. LeverEdge Studios creates content that inspires, educates, and entertains. We produce everything from documentaries to podcasts and interactive series. By combining tech and media, we're able to shape narratives and influence culture in ways we once only dreamed of.<br><br>
            
            One of our most fulfilling projects has been launching the "Pathways Program," where we mentor young people from underprivileged backgrounds, equipping them with tech and media skills that open doors to prosperous careers. LeverEdge's mission to empower the next generation mirrors your teachings on goal-setting and purpose, Coach. We emphasize relational, financial, career, and reputational goals, helping our mentees develop holistically, just as you did for us. Each year, we also host the "BE-CAN-DO-HAVE" conference, a tribute to the mindset you taught us, where industry leaders and inspiring voices from around the world gather to share insights and empower others.<br><br>
            
            My family has been my anchor through all of this. My oldest son, now an ambitious young man, works alongside me in the tech department, learning the ropes and building his own career with the same principles you shared. My second child, who was born shortly after bootcamp, is pursuing a degree in media studies, inspired by the very environment we created at LeverEdge. My partner and I have nurtured a home built on love, shared goals, and mutual growth, a foundation built from your teachings on relational goals.<br><br>
            
            Coach, as I reflect on the immense role you played in shaping my journey, I am inspired to honor you and ensure that your legacy lives on. I imagine by now, you may have a touch of gray, embodying wisdom and experience that only time can bring. In your honor, LeverEdge is establishing the Matika Legacy Fund, a scholarship program dedicated to supporting young, aspiring tech and media professionals from all walks of life. This fund will help them access quality education and mentorship, regardless of their financial background, just as you once supported me in finding my path.<br><br>
            
            Additionally, we plan to launch the Matika Mentorship Initiative, a series of workshops, online courses, and resources based on the teachings you shared with us. These sessions will focus on self-awareness, goal-setting, personal branding, and tapping into the subconscious mind. Each lesson will be crafted to instill the values of “BE,” “CAN,” “DO,” and “HAVE,” ensuring that your philosophy reaches and empowers future generations.<br><br>
            
            Finally, we are also planning a grand annual event called the Matika Summit, where leaders in tech, media, and personal development will gather to discuss innovations, exchange insights, and celebrate personal growth and achievement. The summit will be a tribute to the principles you instilled in us, showcasing the impact of your teachings on countless lives.<br><br>
            
            Thank you, Coach Matika, for believing in me when I struggled to believe in myself. Your wisdom and mentorship have shaped me in ways I can never fully express, and it's my honor to carry your legacy forward. I hope that LeverEdge's work can pay forward the inspiration and guidance you gave me, and I look forward to seeing the impact of these initiatives on the next generation of dreamers and doers.<br><br>
            
            With profound respect and gratitude,<br>
